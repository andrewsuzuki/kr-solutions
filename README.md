These are my solutions to the exercises in *The C Programming Language* (Second Edition; also known as K&R), written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

I'm attempting to solve every exercise in the book, since I haven't found a complete repo on GitHub yet (or at least in the first two pages of search results).

Exercises per chapter:

* ch1: 23 ✓
* ch2: 10 ✓
* ch3: 6 ✓
* ch4: 14 ✓
* ch5: 20 -- need 17 through 20
* ch6: 6 ✓
* ch7: 9 ✓
* ch8: 8 -- need 2 through 8
